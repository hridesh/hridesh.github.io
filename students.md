I have contributed (or currently contributing) to the research-based training of a broad body of 31 graduate and postdoc 
students and over 45 undergraduate students between 2005-present. Eight of my former PhD students and postdoctoral 
fellows are faculty and ten are industrial researchers. <b>We are currently recruiting postdoctoral fellows and 
students at all levels. See [my advice](https://hridesh.github.io/prospective) on this matter.

### Academic Geneology

My advisor at University of Virginia was Kevin Sullivan,
whose advisor was David Notkin. 
My academic genealogy goes all the way to [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra), 
who won the Turing award in 1972.

In prior life, I worked at Bell Labs India, the R&D organization of Lucent Technologies. At the time, I was interested in bandwidth and power optimization issues in mobile ad hoc & sensor networks as they scale up. I still keep up with these topics.
