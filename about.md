Rajan is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)
and a Fulbright Scholar.
His research interests are in
Data Science, Software Engineering and Programming Languages 
where he is most known for his design of the 
[Ptolemy programming language](http://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu) that 
showed how to modularly reason about crosscutting concerns and the 
[Boa programming language](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu) 
and its infrastructure that decreases the barriers to data-driven software engineering. 
He leads TADS ([Theoretical and Applied Data Science](https://tads.research.iastate.edu)), 
a transdisciplinary research initiative of faculty and students in 
Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Agriculture, and Engineering. 

Prof. Rajan led the design, approval, and implementation of the 
[M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/ai) at ISU. 
Prof. Rajan co-led (with Associate Deans Arne Hallam and Sriram Sundararajan) 
the committees that designed the [Data Science Minor, Certificate, and 
B.S. degree programs at ISU](https://datascience.iastate.edu). 
He founded the [annual Midwest Big Data Summer School](http://mbds.cs.iastate.edu) 
to deliver broadly accessible data science training, and 
served on the steering committee of the [Midwest Big Data Hub](http://midwestbigdatahub.org).

Prof. Rajan chaired the graduate admissions and recruitment

### Academic Geneology

My advisor at University of Virginia was Kevin Sullivan, 
whose advisor was David Notkin. 
My academic genealogy goes all the way to Edsger Dijkstra.

In prior life, I worked at Bell Labs India, the R&D organization of Lucent Technologies. At the time, I was interested in bandwidth and power optimization issues in mobile ad hoc & sensor networks as they scale up. I still keep up with these topics.
