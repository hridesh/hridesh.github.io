### Academic Geneology

My advisor at University of Virginia was Kevin Sullivan, whose advisor was David Notkin. My academic genealogy goes all the way to Edsger Dijkstra.

In prior life, I worked at Bell Labs India, the R&D organization of Lucent Technologies. At the time, I was interested in bandwidth and power optimization issues in mobile ad hoc & sensor networks as they scale up. I still keep up with these topics.

### Personal

I come from a small town called Mokama in Bihar, India. 
I have had the pleasure to live within 50ft from the river Ganga, 
a major river in India, for most of my childhood. 
If you are from Mokama, I will be glad to hear from you. 
Send me an e-mail and we can share stories :-).

Beside computer science, I love cavaliers (trying to grow into cyclones), 
Dreamworks Animation Movies, driving, racquet ball, paintball, chess, 
and pool (not necessarily in this order). Sometimes, I also pretend to be a handyman.
