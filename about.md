Rajan is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)
and a Fulbright Scholar.
His research interests are in
Data Science, Software Engineering and Programming Languages 
where he is most known for his design of the 
[Ptolemy programming language](https://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu) that 
showed how to modularly reason about crosscutting concerns and the 
[Boa programming language](https://boa.cs.iastate.edu) 
and its infrastructure that decreases the barriers to data-driven software engineering. 
He has been recognized by an NSF CAREER award (2009), 
by the LAS Early Achievement in Research Award (2010), 
a Big-12 Fellowship (2012), 
an ACM Senior Membership (2014), 
an exemplary mentor for Junior Faculty award (2017), 
a Kingland Endowed Professorship (2017), 
an ACM Distinguished Membership (2017), 
a US-UK Fulbright Scholarship (2018),
a Facebook Probability and Programming Award (2020), and 
an Early Achievement in Departmental Leadership Award (2022). 
He has served on the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering and 
ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, and currently serves on the advisory 
board of Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages and the steering committee of 
the [ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH)](https://2024.splashcon.org). 
Earlier in his career, he worked as a Member of Technical Staff at Bell Labs,
Lucent Technologies in Bangalore, India, from 2000 to 2001.
Prof. Rajan was an [ABET](https://ABET.org/) program evaluator from 2018 to 2024 
and now serves as a commissioner for the [ABET Computing Accreditation Commission](https://www.abet.org/about-abet/governance/accreditation-commissions-2/).

### Academic Geneology

My advisor at University of Virginia was Kevin Sullivan, 
whose advisor was David Notkin. 
My academic genealogy goes all the way to Edsger Dijkstra.

In prior life, I worked at Bell Labs India, the R&D organization of Lucent Technologies. At the time, I was interested in bandwidth and power optimization issues in mobile ad hoc & sensor networks as they scale up. I still keep up with these topics.
