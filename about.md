to deliver broadly accessible data science training,
served on the steering committee of the [Midwest Big Data Hub](http://midwestbigdatahub.org),
and led TADS ([Theoretical and Applied Data Science](https://tads.research.iastate.edu)), 
a cross-campus transdisciplinary research initiative of faculty and students interested 
in foundations and applications of Data Science.
After this, he served as the Department Chair of Computer Science from 2019-2023, 
where he oversaw a significant growth period in both students, faculty, staff, and research funding.
During his tenure as Department Chair, Dr. Rajan led the effort in diversity and inclusion

### Academic Geneology

My advisor at University of Virginia was Kevin Sullivan, 
whose advisor was David Notkin. 
My academic genealogy goes all the way to Edsger Dijkstra.

In prior life, I worked at Bell Labs India, the R&D organization of Lucent Technologies. At the time, I was interested in bandwidth and power optimization issues in mobile ad hoc & sensor networks as they scale up. I still keep up with these topics.
