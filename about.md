### Academic Geneology

My advisor at University of Virginia was Kevin Sullivan, 
whose advisor was David Notkin. 
My academic genealogy goes all the way to Edsger Dijkstra.

In prior life, I worked at Bell Labs India, the R&D organization of Lucent Technologies. At the time, I was interested in bandwidth and power optimization issues in mobile ad hoc & sensor networks as they scale up. I still keep up with these topics.
