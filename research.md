* Data science, SE &amp; PL for data-intensive systems,
  and data-driven SE.
* Modular reasoning about properties of software.
* Advanced modularity and separation of concerns mechanisms
  and modular reasoning about such mechanisms.

### Research Projects

My recent scholarly endeavors have been concentrated on investigating the 
modularity of AI-powered systems, with a special focus on deep learning 
technologies. One of my primary concerns centers on the substantial financial 
and environmental costs associated with training, updating, and repurposing 
large-scale AI models like deep neural networks. To illustrate, it has been 
reported that the training of ChatGPT alone cost approximately $100 million, 
and updating its core algorithms involves significant expenses. Against this 
backdrop, my research aims to introduce more sustainable and efficient 
solutions by pioneering methods for the modular decomposition of these 
expensive AI models. This would enable the isolated reuse or replacement of 
specific modules, thereby optimizing resource utilization and potentially 
driving down overall costs.

My overarching research agenda is dedicated to enhancing programmer 
productivity while elevating the reliability of the software systems they 
create. Specifically, I focus on the development of innovative programming 
abstractions that mitigate error-prone aspects, bolster modularity, and 
facilitate modular reasoning. Through these abstractions, compilers and 
frameworks can automatically implement complex concerns, thereby minimizing 
the likelihood of errors and boosting productivity. Furthermore, by 
advancing modularity and modular reasoning, my work aims to improve 
scalability in both manual and automated reasoning, as well as in 
verification procedures. For an in-depth look at my research endeavors,
