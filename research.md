My research interest spans the following areas.

* Modularity, modular reasoning
* Programming languages, Software Engineering, and Compilers
* Data science, especially Software Engineering of Data Science software.
* Concurrency, especially modular reasoning about concurrency correctness and performance. Scalable support for modular verification of concurrency properties in compilers.
* Advanced separation of concerns mechanisms such as events, reactive signals, and aspects and modular reasoning about such mechanisms.

I have spent the majority of my career thinking about modularity and modular reasoning issues and inventing programming abstractions that allow reasoning mechanisms to scale to larger programs, to tackle new class of modularization mechanisms, and to tackle new class of properties.

### Ptolemy Project

Our work on the [Ptolemy project](http://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu) has created more modular mechanisms for reasoning about crosscutting concerns.

### Boa Project

Our work on the [Boa](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu) programming language 
and its infrastructure has created linguistic abstractions for data-driven 
science that scale because the language design ensures more modular 
reasoning about runtime tasks. 
A deployed setup of Boa (<http://boa.cs.iastate.edu>) is used by hundreds 
of scientists around the world to study open source projects for a 
variety of purposes and over three dozen external research papers have 
appeared so far that have used Boa as a research instrument.

### Panini Project

Our work on the [Panini project](http://paninij.org) has created 
abstractions for improving modular reasoning about concurrent programs.

I direct the [Laboratory for Software Design](http://design.cs.iastate.edu) 
in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.iastate.edu). 
In 2016 and 2017 we have also organized the 
[Midwest Big Data Summer School](http://mbds.cs.iastate.edu), a one-week, 
intensive curriculum aimed at early career researchers to get them 
started in data-driven research.
