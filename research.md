My research interest spans the following areas.

* Software Engineering (SE), programming languages (PL), and data science
* Data science, SE &amp; PL for data-intensive systems,
  and data-driven SE.
* Modular reasoning about properties of software.
* Advanced modularity and separation of concerns mechanisms
  and modular reasoning about such mechanisms.

### Ptolemy Project

Our work on the [Ptolemy project](http://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu) has created more modular mechanisms for reasoning about crosscutting concerns.

### Boa Project

Our work on the [Boa](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu) programming language 
and its infrastructure has created linguistic abstractions for data-driven 
science that scale because the language design ensures more modular 
reasoning about runtime tasks. 
A deployed setup of Boa (<http://boa.cs.iastate.edu>) is used by hundreds 
of scientists around the world to study open source projects for a 
variety of purposes and over three dozen external research papers have 
appeared so far that have used Boa as a research instrument.

### Panini Project

Our work on the [Panini project](http://paninij.org) has created 
abstractions for improving modular reasoning about concurrent programs.

I direct the [Laboratory for Software Design](http://design.cs.iastate.edu) 
in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.iastate.edu). 
In 2016 and 2017 we have also organized the 
[Midwest Big Data Summer School](http://mbds.cs.iastate.edu), a one-week, 
intensive curriculum aimed at early career researchers to get them 
started in data-driven research.
