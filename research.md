### Research Projects

My recent research has focussed on data science and concurrency.
My overarching research program is aimed at improving programmer productivity, and correctness of software systems that
they produce. In particular, I am interested in designing new programming abstractions that
abstract away error-prone concerns, improve modularity, and improve modular reasoning.
By abstracting away error-prone concerns, and having compilers and programming frameworks
automatically provide adequate implementation of such concerns, my research aspires to reduce
potential for errors in software, and improve productivity.
By improving modularity and modular reasoning, my research strives for improved scalability
in both manual and automatic reasoning as well as verification processes.
<!--I am interested in two specific questions: (1) <EM>how can we enable more modular reasoning 
about concurrent programs?</EM> and (2) <EM>what are adequate programming abstractions for 
data intensive programs (also popularly referred to as Big Data programs) that facilitate
reasoning about such programs?</EM>-->
My main research projects are:</p>


* [Boa](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu), a domain-specific
language and its infrastructure whose goal is to significantly ease the
experimental cost of mining ultra-large-scale open source repositories.
Boa is a research infrastructure that consists of a domain-specific language, its compiler and data
updating tools, terabytes (and growing) of raw data from open source
repositories that contains hundreds of thousands of open source projects,
a backend based on map-reduce to effectively analyze this dataset,
a compute cluster, and a web-based frontend for writing analysis programs.

Boa project has been supported in part by the following grants.

### Ptolemy Project

Our work on the [Ptolemy project](http://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu) has created more modular mechanisms for reasoning about crosscutting concerns.

### Boa Project

Our work on the [Boa](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu) programming language 
and its infrastructure has created linguistic abstractions for data-driven 
science that scale because the language design ensures more modular 
reasoning about runtime tasks. 
A deployed setup of Boa (<http://boa.cs.iastate.edu>) is used by hundreds 
of scientists around the world to study open source projects for a 
variety of purposes and over three dozen external research papers have 
appeared so far that have used Boa as a research instrument.

### Panini Project

Our work on the [Panini project](http://paninij.org) has created 
abstractions for improving modular reasoning about concurrent programs.

I direct the [Laboratory for Software Design](https://lab-design.github.io) 
in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.iastate.edu). 
In 2016 and 2017 we have also organized the 
[Midwest Big Data Summer School](http://mbds.cs.iastate.edu), a one-week, 
intensive curriculum aimed at early career researchers to get them 
started in data-driven research.
