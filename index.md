Hridesh Rajan serves as the Dean of the [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.tulane.edu) at [Tulane University](https://tulane.edu) and as a Professor in the [Tulane University Department of Computer Science](https://sse.tulane.edu/cs). Before Tulane, he was the Kingland Professor and Chair of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu) (2019–2024) and the founding Professor-in-Charge of [Data Science Programs](https://datascience.iastate.edu) (2017–2019).

Rajan’s research spans programming languages, software engineering, and data science. He is known for the design of the **Ptolemy** programming language, which advanced modular reasoning about crosscutting concerns, and for the **Boa** language and its infrastructure, which lowered barriers to data-driven software engineering at ultra-large scale.

His work has been recognized by the U.S. National Science Foundation with a **CAREER** award, by an **Early Achievement in Research** Award, by a **Big-12 Fellowship** and the **Kingland Professorship**, and by an **Exemplary Mentor for Junior Faculty** award. He is a **Fellow of the AAAS**, a **US–UK Fulbright Scholar**, and a **Distinguished Member of the ACM**. He also serves as a **Commissioner** on ABET’s **Computing Accreditation Commission**.

Rajan has served on the editorial boards of *IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering* and *ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes*, and currently serves on the advisory board of *Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL)* and on the steering committee of the [ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH)](https://2024.splashcon.org).

Guided by a collaborative, outcomes-oriented leadership style, he focuses on building high-performing teams, launching programs that meet national needs, and creating partnerships that translate research into societal impact. At Tulane, he is building an interdisciplinary-first, translational, School of Science and Engineering focused on Better Lives.
