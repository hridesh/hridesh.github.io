In the realm of academia, the most profound indicator of our success lies in 
the caliber of students we mentor and prepare for the future. 
This year, it has been my privilege to collaborate closely with two exceptional 
individuals, guiding them to the successful completion of their doctoral and 
postdoctoral training programs.

Mohammad Wardat finished his doctoral training, and defended his PhD thesis.
His thesis is noteworthy in that it opened a new sub-field, fault localization
within deep neural network. Through a series of papers, his research advanced 
this area. Dr. Wardat will start his tenure-track position at Oakland University.

Ali Ghanbari and I have collaborated on a number of topics. One of the topic 
that has gained traction is mutation-based fault localization of deep neural
networks that will appear at the 2023 Automated Software Engineering Conference.
Dr. Ghanbari will begin his tenure-track position at Auburn University in January 2024. 

Congratulations to both!
