VIRTUAL SPLASH has three main streams:

* SPLASH-I for OOPSLA and ECOOP research papers;
* SPLASH-II for REBASE industry-oriented talks;
* SPLASH-III for the major co-located events: GPCE/SLE on Sunday/Monday; 
  Onward! Papers and Essays on Tuesday; SAS/DLS on Wednesday/Thursday; 
  and OOPSLA research papers on Friday; 
* SPLASH-IV through SPLASH VI have workshops

MIRRORING In what we think is world first, SPLASH will do 12 hour mirroring, each conference days will be exactly 12 hours long with every single talk scheduled to repeat with a 12 hour delay. Therefore: whatever YOUR time zone happens to be, you can attend SPLASH during any convenient 12 hour block. For example: Alex from New Zealand plans to attend between 8am and 8pm NZ Standard Time; Jan from Czechia plans to attend between 8am and 8pm Central European Time, while Hridesh from Iowa plans to attend between 9am and 9pm Central Daylight Time!
