title: Panini compiler development, now on GitHub 
---

For the last several years, my research lab has been developing the 
[Panini programming language](http://paninij.org) whose goals are to make 
concurrent programming easier and concurrent programs free of concurrency 
related defects.

So far we had used SourceForge for majority of our development, but going
forward we will move all of our efforts to GitHub. Yes indeed, we have been
slow to adopt. 

Primary reason for this move has been two fold: better support for the 
git SCM & issues that we have been using in the past, much nicer support 
for documentation and web-pages. 

Migrating open and closed issues has been bit of a challenge, but 
we hope to slowly migrate all of our development. The new (old) repository 
is [Panini project](https://github.com/hridesh/panc) and some work has already started.
