The <a href="http://design.cs.iastate.edu">Laboratory for Software Design</a> in the
Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University is seeking a
postdoctoral fellow to work on the Boa project. The Boa project is developing
an infrastructure for big code mining and using the infrastructure for such
software engineering goals as specification inference. For more details about
the project please refer to http://boa.cs.iastate.edu. The initial position is
for one year with the possibility of extensions up to three years. A qualified
candidate has: (1) a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Software Engineering or a
closely related field, and (2) outstanding ability to carry out research.
Candidates who are in the final stages of obtaining their Ph.D. will also be
considered.

The nature of our project will provide an excellent opportunity for a young
scientist to be trained at the interface of programming languages, software
engineering, and data science.  Our philosophy of postdoctoral mentoring
recognizes that the postdoctoral tenure is a time of transition into an
independent scientific career, and thus we take the primary goals in mentoring
as helping the young scientists to establish strong research credentials and
make informed choices regarding a future direction in academia or industry.
The incumbent will be a key member of our research team and be involved in
organizing and coordinating all scientific aspects of this project, including
experimental design, the guidance of graduate students, writing of manuscripts,
and preparing project meetings and progress reports.

To apply please send the following to <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh">Prof. Hridesh Rajan</a> at
<hridesh@iastate.edu>:

1. a cover letter briefly summarizing your qualifications
and describing your interest in the position and anticipated start date
