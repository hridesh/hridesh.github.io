title: Data Science Minor and Certificate Approved! 
---

Just received words from the Iowa State University Office of the Senior Vice President and Provost
that the Data Science Minor and Data Science Certificate are approved.

The design and approval of these two new educational programs at Iowa State University had taken 
much of my time since Summer 2015. The design was done by an university-wide committee that consisted
of Raymond Arrit, Arne Hallam, Chinmay Hegde, Kevin Kane, Dengpan Liu, 
Hridesh Rajan and Sriram Sundararajan. 
I served as the chair of this committee.

From the proposal, 
&quot;<EM>The certificate is intended for students studying any discipline at Iowa State University 
with the goal of enabling them to work in data science.
The certificate consists of nine credit hours of data science core courses, 
nine credit hours of data science electives, and a three-credit data science 
capstone that is expected to provide an experiential learning experience. 
The courses in the data science certificate are designed to provide students 
with the requisite background that would enable them to take jobs with 
significant data science components, e.g., establishing and operating data 
analysis pipelines. The capstone will provide an opportunity for students 
to apply data science concepts to a domain problem while working in a 
multi-disciplinary team setting.</EM>&quot;
