After 19 amazing years at [Iowa State University Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu),I will be moving to 
[Tulane University](https://tulane.edu)
as the next Dean of the [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.tulane.edu).
My family are I are excited about our life in the vibrant city of 
[New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans).

Read my message to the Tulane Science and Engineering community below:  

Dear Friends and Colleagues of SSE,

I am truly honored to join you as the new Dean of the School of Science & Engineering at Tulane University.  I am excited about the immense potential of Tulane’s School of Science & Engineering (SSE) and thankful for the trust that President Fitts and Provost Forman have placed in me.  Already an excellent institution, SSE will rise into the top science and engineering schools in the coming years.

Joining SSE represents a unique opportunity for me to contribute to an institution that aligns with my values and provides the opportunity to lead a school poised to make significant contributions to solving the pressing challenges of our time through transdisciplinary research, education, and community outreach.  Tulane embodies the attributes that I value in an institution: a deep commitment to access, student success and EDI, a world-class research enterprise, an innovative, entrepreneurial, and inclusive culture, and an ambition to extend its impact to its host community and the world. 

The SSE, in particular, is notable for its combination of the behavioral sciences, physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, and mathematics – creating an exceptionally rich environment for innovative programs and interdisciplinary research.  Tulane SSE’s strengths lay at the intersection of its core disciplines, and its strong focus on interdisciplinarity is very attractive to me as the Dean to build upon.  Health, energy, climate, and AI will be central issues for humanity to address for the next few decades – and all problems of the future will require transdisciplinary solutions.  

My plan for leading involves deep engagement with all stakeholders – students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the community as a whole – so I may understand our strengths, aspirations, and opportunities.  In the first few months, I will prioritize listening sessions to gather insights that will help shape our strategic goals.  Working closely with President Fitts, Provost Forman, the SSE Board of Advisors, the SSE Executive Committee, industry, and our dedicated faculty, staff and students, we will translate these insights into concrete and audacious goals.  Our collective efforts will focus on enhancing our interdisciplinary research, fostering innovation, and growing our strong, inclusive community that supports academic excellence and groundbreaking discoveries.

On a personal note, my family and I are absolutely ecstatic about moving to NOLA!  The vibrant culture, rich history, and warm hospitality offered by the people who make the city so unique, are incredibly appealing to us.  We are excited to immerse ourselves in the unique blend of music, cuisine, and festivals that make NOLA so special.  From the excitement of Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest to the upcoming Super Bowl festivities – and everything in between, there is always something amazing happening in this city.  We love Cajun and Creole food and are particularly looking forward to indulging in all the culinary delights that NOLA has to offer.  We are thrilled to start this new chapter and become part of and contribute to the NOLA community!

Warm regards,

Hridesh Rajan, PhD  
Dean, School of Science and Engineering  
Tulane University
