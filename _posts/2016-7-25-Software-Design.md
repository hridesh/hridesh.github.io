title: Object-oriented Analysis and Design in Fall 2016! 
---

I will be teaching a course on object-oriented analysis and design this Fall 
at Iowa State University 
after a long hiatus. I last taught that course in Fall 2007. 

Coincidently, that was the first course that I ever taught as an independent
instructor, so going back to it is especially exciting and I am looking forward to 
trying out many new ideas during the Fall 2016 edition.

This is also going to be my first completely online course.
The plan is to design and teach couple of editions locally and then expand further. 
ISU instructional designer Emmanuel Saka is helping me transition the course material to an
online audience, and in the process we are learning quite a few new things together. 
Me about instructional design, and Emmanuel about software design.
