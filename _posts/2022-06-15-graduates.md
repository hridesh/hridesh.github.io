I am celebrating the graduation of Sumon Biswas, Rangeet Pan and Iris Ma.
Sumon and Rangeet were PhD students in my lab, and Iris was an undergraduate 
research assistant.
After graduation Sumon Biswas will start a postdoctoral position at Carnegie 
Mellon University, Rangeet Pan will start as a researcher at IBM TJ Watson Research Center, 
and Iris Ma will start her PhD program at the University of California, Irvine. 

Congratulations, Dr. Biswas, Dr. Pan, and soon-to-be-Dr. Ma!
