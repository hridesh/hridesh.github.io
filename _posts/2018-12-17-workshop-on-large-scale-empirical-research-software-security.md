title: "Fulbright Award Leads to International Workshop"
---

The J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board had selected Prof. Rajan
for the 2018-19 U.S. Scholar Award.
This award led to an international workshop on
large-scale empirical research on software security.

An important class of cybersecurity problems arises due to flaws in software code. There is a growing body of research on studying large bodies of code to understand software security problems but much work is needed on improving sharing of research results, enabling better comparative analysis, improving reproducibility of research results in this area, and increasing reusability of research artifacts. 

This workshop held on December 17, 2018 at the National Cyber Security Centre 
in the UK brought together an international group of researchers 
to understand the challenges in achieving these goals, formulate requirements, 
and to prioritize them. 
The workshop was co-organized by Hridesh Rajan (Iowa State University) 
and Awais Rashid (University of Bristol, UK).
It was supported by the National Cyber Security Centre, UK.
