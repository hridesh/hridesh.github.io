This Fall 2020 semester, I am teaching an advanced topics seminar on 
the idea of Modularity in Software Engineering.
The goal of this seminar is to discuss some classic and recent papers 
on modularity in software engineering and programming languages.  

We will be reading the following papers. 

1. Early ideas: Separation of Concerns, Information Hiding
 - E. Dijkstra, "[On the role of scientific thought](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html)", 
   From Edsger W. Dijkstra, Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective, Springer-Verlag, 1982.
