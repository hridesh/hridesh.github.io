This Fall 2020 semester, I am teaching an advanced topics seminar on 
the idea of Modularity in Software Engineering.
The goal of this seminar to read some classic papers on modularity in 
software engineering and programming languages research.  

We will be reading the following papers. 

1. E. Dijkstra, "[On the role of scientific thought](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html)", 
   From Edsger W. Dijkstra, Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective, Springer-Verlag, 1982. 
2. Parnas, D.L., "[On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems Into Modules](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361598.361623)" 
   Communications of the ACM, Vol. 15, No. 12, pp. 1053-1058, December, 1972 
3. Edsger W. Dijkstra, "[Go To Statement Considered Harmful](http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/)", 
   Communications of the ACM, Vol. 11, No. 3, March 1968, pp. 147-148.
4. Peri Tarr, Harold Ossher, William Harrison, Stanley M. Sutton, Jr., 
   "[N degrees of separation: multi-dimensional separation of concerns](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/841000)", 
   ICSE '99: Proceedings of the 21st international conference on Software engineering, Los Angeles, California, USA, 1999.
