title: A basic blog based on Jekyll is up and running!
---

Good evening! Its Monday, July 25, 2016 and I just got a basic blog up and running. 
I am using the Jekyll page generator. Thanks to Barry Clark and others for putting 
together the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) that
makes the entire process a piece of cake.
