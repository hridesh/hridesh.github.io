title: First class Effect at OOPSLA/SPLASH 2016! 
---

We just heard that our work on first class effect will appear at the OOPSLA/SPLASH 2016 conference.
This is a collaborative effort with my former PhD student 
[Yuheng Long](www.cs.iastate.edu/~csgzlong/) and 
[Yu David Liu](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~davidl/). 
This work asks: what if software could inspect its side-effects 
to make runtime decisions?" 

Looks like we are scheduled to present on the last day of the SPLASH conference.
See you there!
