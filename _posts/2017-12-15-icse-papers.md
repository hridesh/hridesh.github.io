Our lab has had two papers selected to appear at the 40th International Conference on 
Software Engineering to be held at Gothenberg, Sweden from May 27-June 3, 2018.

The first paper that has Ganesha Upadhyaya and Hridesh Rajan as authors introduces
``<EM>Collective Program Analysis</EM>’’, a technique for accelerating tasks that 
require deeper analysis of large code corpus. 

The second paper that is a collaborative work with Tianyi Zhang and Dr. Miryung Kim 
utilizes program analysis facilities within Boa with mining techniques outside Boa 
to study misuses of code examples in the popular StackOverflow forums.
