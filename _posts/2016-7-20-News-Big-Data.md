In June 2016, a team of individuals organized the Inaugural 
[Midwest Big Data Summer School](http://mbds.cs.iastate.edu).
The team consisted of 
myself and [Pavan Aduri](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~pavan) as general co-chairs,
[Adisak Sukul](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/adisak-sukul) as the local arrangements chair,
[Mehdi Bagherzadeh](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/mehdi-bagherzadeh) 
and [Hoda Gholami](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/hoda-gholami) as web/publicity chairs, and 
[Hoan Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/site/nguyenanhhoan/) and 
[Ganesha Upadhyaya](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/ganesha-upadhyaya) as registration chairs.

A news article about this summer school just came out
