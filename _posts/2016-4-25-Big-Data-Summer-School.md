title: Midwest Big Data Summer School will Happen!
---

Myself and [Pavan Aduri](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~pavan) wrote to 
the [Midwest Big Data Hub](http://midwestbigdatahub.org/) to seek support for 
organizing the Inaugural Midwest Big Data Summer School in June 2016.
Just heard that proposal was accepted, although with a significant reduction
in budget. 

Our aim to organize this summer school as a one week, intensive curriculum 
aimed at early career researchers to get them started in data‐driven research. 
The school will include full day lectures on topics ranging from: data acquisition, 
data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, descriptive data analysis, data analysis tools and techniques, visualization and communication, ethical issues in data science, reproducibility and repeatability, and understanding of domain/context. The summer school will also include hands‐on data analysis experience. No prerequisites will be assumed.

Looking forward to organizing the event. More details will become available here at 
the [Midwest Big Data Summer School](http://mbds.cs.iastate.edu) web-site.
