### Key Accomplishments in Training, Teaching, and Curriculum Development

- Led development, and approval of five new degree programs at Iowa State University: MS in Artificial Intelligence, B.A. in Computer Science, 
  a Data Science (DS) Minor, a DS Certificate, and a DS B.S. Degree. 
  Responsibilities included: developing consensus; organizing
  obtaining and acting on university-wide feedback; developing the 
  program proposals with early and frequent feedback; presenting the 
  program to university bodies; and helping negotiate program governance. 
  Also, co-designed and co-developed four new core courses for these programs.

- Developed and revised a new pedagogy and a textbook draft 
  to teach programming languages and functional programming to students who start in Computer Science programs 
  that teach an imperative language such as Java
  that led to 20% improvement in the student success rate. The textbook appeared as:
  Hridesh Rajan, ``An Experiential Introduction to Principles of Programming Languages,'' 
  MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, pp. 304, May 2022.

- Contributed (or currently contributing) to the [research-based training](/students/) 
  of a broad body of 31 graduate and postdoc students and 
  over 45 undergraduate students between 2005-present.

* [Spring 2006](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/362/06/01/)
* [Fall 2006](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/362/06/02/)
* [Spring 2007](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/362/07/01/)
* [Fall 2007](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/362/07/02/)

#### COMS 342: An Undergraduate Course on Programming Language Design, Semantics and Implementation

I have taught (or currently teaching) the following editions of Com S 342.

* [Fall 2015](http://bb.its.iastate.edu):
This edition is also using the book draft <EM>Programming Languages: Design, Semantics, 
and Implementation</EM> that uses the Java programming language as the defining language.
In this edition of the course, the interpreter framework used by the course saw significant
overhaul. We also overhauled the semantics descriptions, and provided more coverage of
inductive specifications, and additionally covered ideas behind a module system.
The book draft and exercises were also refined and subsequently clarified.


* [Spring 2015](http://bb.its.iastate.edu):
This edition is also using the book draft <EM>Programming Languages: Design, Semantics, and Implementation</EM>
that uses the Java programming language as the defining language. In this edition of the course,
the book draft and exercises were refined and clarified.


* [Fall 2014](http://bb.its.iastate.edu):
These editions are using a new book <EM>Programming Languages: Design, Semantics, and Implementation</EM>
that uses the Java programming language as the defining language. In these editions of the course,
we also covered several additional topics not covered in previous editions, e.g. concurrency,
event-based programming, reactive programming, etc...


* [Fall 2011, Spring 2012, Fall 2012, and Spring 2013](http://bb.its.iastate.edu):
These editions are also using the book <EM>Essentials of Programming Languages, 3rd Edition 
by Friedman and Wand</EM>. In these editions of the course, we covered additional topics
not included in the textbook, e.g. garbage collection.


* [Spring 2011](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/342/11/01):
This edition is also using the book <EM>Essentials of Programming Languages, 3rd Edition 
by Friedman and Wand</EM>. In this edition of the course, we covered more
topics compared to the Spring 2009 edition. In particular, lectures on semantics
were extended to cover continuations, exceptions, and threads. I also added a module
on types and type checking for this edition.



* [Spring 2010](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/342/10/01):
This edition also used the book <EM>Essentials of Programming Languages, 3rd Edition 
by Friedman and Wand</EM>. In this edition of the course, we covered more
topics compared to the Spring 2009 edition. In particular, lectures on semantics
were extended to cover continuations, exceptions, and threads. I also added a module
on types and type checking for this edition.



* [Spring 2009](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/342/09/01):
This edition used the book <EM>Essentials of Programming Languages, 3rd Edition 
by Friedman and Wand</EM>. Main change in this edition was to adopt the
3rd edition of textbook, which required significant modifications in lecture notes,
homework styles and exam styles.



* [Fall 2007](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/342/07/02):
This edition used the book <EM>Essentials of Programming Languages, 2nd Edition 
by Friedman, Wand and Haynes</EM>. Most of this edition was adopted from a
previously taught course by (http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens)Prof. Gary T. Leavens.

#### Com S 541: A Graduate Course on Programming Language Design and Semantics

Below you will find description of the course
Com S 541 as taught by Hridesh Rajan
at Iowa State University and elsewhere.


* [Fall 2015](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/541/):
This edition used the lecture notes on Software Foundations developed by
Benjamin C. Pierce <EM>et al.</EM> and the textbook
<EM>&quot;Types and Programming Languages&quot;</EM> by Benjamin C. Pierce.
Compared to previous editions that integrated projects, this edition used
homework and exams as the primary evaluation medium.
The course utilized ISU blackboard system for distributing material to students.



<!--*
(http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/541/2011/fall/)Fall 2011:
This edition is currently under construction. It will use the textbook
<EM>&quot;Types and Programming Languages&quot;</EM> by Benjamin C. Pierce.
-->

* [Fall 2010](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/541/2010/fall/):
This edition also used the lecture notes on Software Foundations developed by
Benjamin C. Pierce <EM>et al.</EM> and the textbook
<EM>&quot;Types and Programming Languages&quot;</EM> by Benjamin C. Pierce.
Besides minor changes this edition was similar to the Fall 2009 edition.


* [Fall 2009](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/541/2009/fall/)
This edition used the lecture notes on Software Foundations developed by
Benjamin C. Pierce <EM>et al.</EM> and the textbook
<EM>&quot;Types and Programming Languages&quot;</EM> by Benjamin C. Pierce.
A major change from last edition of this course was to use
the (http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/coq/)Coq proof assistant
throughout this course for expressing language semantics, type systems, and
for proving properties about them.


* [Fall 2008](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/teaching/541/2008/fall/)
This edition used the textbooks
<EM>&quot;Types and Programming Languages&quot;</EM> by Benjamin C. Pierce
and
<EM>&quot;the Formal Semantics of Programming Languages&quot;</EM> by Glynn Winskel.
